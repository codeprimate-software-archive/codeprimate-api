Codeprimate Core API
====================

The Codeprimate Core API is a Java Class Library containing common, useful utilities, classes and components
for creating Java applications.

The intended purpose of this project is to build an experimental set of reusable Java classes and components
that form a common, core API, independent of any other Java Class Library, serving as the foundation for building
other Java applications.  This API along with other useful utilities encapsulate common design patterns that re-occur
during software development rather than having to re-write these utilities for each software development project.

This project is an incubator, a "lab" for creating these common classes and components, and eventually will be
rolled into the cp-elements API/Framework (and Java Class Library, not yet published).

All the classes and components in this library come from existing software development projects and have been battle
tested in production.  While the corresponding test suite classes have been included in this project, the test coverage
is incomplete, and full test coverage may not be done until these classes/components have been promoted to
the cp-elements API/Framework.
